This are my compiled notes on React Native. I hope you find them useful.

They includes all the common questions and errors which are usually not covered in clone app yt videos, and also some of the best practices to follow while developing a react native app which i came across.

like:

- [[What is Expo & Why is Expo?]]
- [[How to generate APK?]]
- [[I deleted gradle from my system, what to do?]]
- [[Automating the build and deployment process using github actions]]
- [[When to use Expo Go APP and when not to?]]

I am curious guy, so i liked to go deep into topics so this also includes some of the engineering concepts and how things work under the hood:

- [[How React Native Works?]]
- [[How to Profile React Native App?]]

Explore this notes either by searching for specific topic or [[tags]].
